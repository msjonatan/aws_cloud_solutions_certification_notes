# AWS Solutions Architect Certification – Session 1

*(Note: Text is in English, as the exam is in English. Key AWS/cloud terms are provided in Spanish (in parentheses) where helpful.)*

## Introduction

Welcome to Session 1 of the AWS Solutions Architect course. In this session, we establish foundational knowledge of the AWS Cloud, its certifications, and essential cloud computing concepts. We will examine the different categories of AWS certifications, fundamental benefits of cloud computing, various service and deployment models, and why AWS is the leading provider. Additionally, we will explore the global infrastructure of AWS, how to create and manage an AWS account, and introduce basic cost management tools. This session provides the groundwork upon which all future sessions will build.

## Topics Covered

- AWS Certifications Overview (Descripción General de Certificaciones AWS)
- Cloud Computing Fundamentals (Fundamentos de la Informática en la Nube)
- Cloud Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
- Cloud Deployment Models: Public, Private, Hybrid
- Why AWS? (¿Por qué AWS?)
- AWS Global Infrastructure (Infraestructura Global de AWS)
- Setting Up an AWS Account (Creación de una Cuenta AWS)
- AWS Pricing Calculator, Cost Explorer, and Tagging
- Budget Configuration (Configuración de Presupuesto)

## AWS Certifications Overview (Descripción General de Certificaciones AWS)

AWS certifications validate cloud skills and are divided into four categories:

1. **Foundational (Fundacional)**:
   - **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (AWS Certificado Cloud Practitioner)**:  
     Basic cloud knowledge, no experience required.

2. **Associate (Asociado)**:
   - **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (Arquitecto de Soluciones – Asociado)**  
   - **AWS Certified Developer – Associate (Desarrollador – Asociado)**  
   - **AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate (Administrador SysOps – Asociado)**

3. **Professional (Profesional)**:
   - **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional (Arquitecto de Soluciones – Profesional)**  
   - **AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional (Ingeniero DevOps – Profesional)**

4. **Specialty (Especialidad)**:
   - Focused on areas like Security, Networking, Databases, Analytics, or Machine Learning.

No certification is a strict prerequisite for another, but it’s common to start with the Cloud Practitioner and then move to Associate and Professional levels. Certifications expire after 3 years, and obtaining a higher-level certification renews the lower-level ones. Practice exams and scenario-based learning are essential for success.

## Cloud Computing Fundamentals (Fundamentos de la Informática en la Nube)

Traditional IT infrastructures (infraestructura de TI tradicional) rely on owning data centers, hardware procurement, and complex maintenance. Cloud computing (informática en la nube) changes this paradigm, offering:

- **On-Demand Self-Service (Autoservicio Bajo Demanda):** Access resources anytime without manual intervention.
- **Broad Network Access (Amplio Acceso a la Red):** Use multiple platforms and devices via the internet.
- **Resource Pooling (Agrupación de Recursos):** Providers serve multiple customers from shared infrastructure.
- **Rapid Elasticity (Elasticidad Rápida):** Scale resources up or down instantly.
- **Measured Service (Servicio Medido):** Pay only for what you use (pago por uso).

**Benefits:**
- Convert CAPEX to OPEX, reducing upfront costs.
- Achieve economies of scale and lower per-unit costs.
- Stop guessing capacity; scale on demand.
- Increase speed and agility; provision in minutes.
- Focus on innovation rather than infrastructure maintenance.
- Gain global reach with minimal effort.

---

## Cloud Service Models

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**  
  Example: Amazon EC2 (Máquinas Virtuales).  
  You manage OS, applications, and data; AWS manages underlying hardware.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**  
  Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  
  Deploy code without managing the underlying infrastructure.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS):**  
  Example: Salesforce.  
  Fully managed applications you consume over the internet.

---

## Cloud Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud (Nube Pública):** AWS manages infrastructure shared among customers.
- **Private Cloud (Nube Privada):** Dedicated environment for one organization.
- **Hybrid Cloud (Nube Híbrida):** Combine on-premises (en las instalaciones) or private infrastructure with public cloud resources for flexibility.

---

## Why AWS? (¿Por qué AWS?)

AWS is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform:

- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for what you consume.
- **Elasticity & Agility:** Rapidly scale resources.
- **Global Infrastructure:** Regions (Regiones), Availability Zones (Zonas de Disponibilidad), and Edge Locations (Puntos de Presencia) for low latency and compliance.
- **Security & Compliance:** Built-in controls, encryption, and strong compliance frameworks.
- **Innovation & Breadth of Services:** Over 200 fully featured services.

---

## AWS Global Infrastructure (Infraestructura Global de AWS)

- **Regions (Regiones):** Geographically isolated areas; choose based on compliance, latency, and services.
- **Availability Zones (Zonas de Disponibilidad):** Physically separate data centers for high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Edge Locations (Puntos de Presencia):** Improve latency and content delivery via AWS CloudFront.

By leveraging Regions and AZs, you can design globally distributed, highly available architectures.

---

## Setting Up an AWS Account (Creación de una Cuenta AWS)

1. **Sign Up at AWS Free Tier:** [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)  
   Enter email, password, and billing details.
2. **Identity Verification:** Provide phone number.
3. **Support Plan (Plan de Soporte):** Basic (Básico) is free.
4. **Start Exploring:** The free tier offers limited usage of popular services for up to 12 months.

Regularly monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.

---

## AWS Pricing Calculator, Cost Explorer, and Tagging

- **AWS Pricing Calculator:** Estimate costs before deploying workloads.
- **AWS Cost Explorer (Explorador de Costos):** Analyze and visualize spending over time. Filter by service, region, or tags.
- **Tags (Etiquetas):** Key-value pairs to organize resources (e.g., by project, department). Helps with cost allocation and simplifies searching.
- **AWS Budgets (Presupuestos):**  
  Set custom budgets and receive alerts if costs or usage exceed thresholds. Predictive alerts help prevent overspending.

---

## Budget Configuration (Configuración de Presupuesto)

Creating a budget helps maintain financial control:

1. Go to the Budgets Dashboard and create a new budget.
2. Define cost thresholds (umbral de costo).
3. Set alerts for actual or forecasted overspending.
4. Use automated actions to prevent resource sprawl.

Budgets and Cost Explorer work together to ensure proactive cost management.

---

## Summary

**Key Takeaways:**
- AWS certifications guide your learning path, from foundational to professional and specialty levels.
- Cloud computing replaces upfront investments with on-demand resources, improving speed, agility, and global reach.
- Service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and deployment models (Public, Private, Hybrid) meet diverse architectural needs.
- AWS leads with broad services, robust security, and global infrastructure.
- Setting up an AWS account and using the AWS Free Tier enables hands-on practice.
- AWS Cost Explorer, Budgets, and tagging help you manage and optimize costs effectively.
