## Cloud Computing Overview

### Traditional IT Infrastructure

- **Capital Expenses (CAPEX):** Investments in planning, space, installation, personnel, physical security, capacity predictions, and maintenance.
- Challenges:
  - Limited scalability.
  - Maintenance complexity and costs.
  - Hardware upgrades take time.
  - Requires a 24/7 IT team.

### Cloud Computing (Informática en la Nube)

- **Definition:** Delivery of computing power, databases, storage, applications, and other IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- **Advantages:**
  - Transforms infrastructure into software.
  - Provides flexibility and operational cost efficiency.
  - Scalable and elastic.
  - Removes the need for data center management.

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. **On-demand self-service:**
   - Users can provision resources without human intervention from the service provider.

2. **Broad network access:**
   - Accessible through various platforms such as web browsers, CLI, or SDKs.

3. **Resource pooling (Agrupación de recursos):**
   - Multiple clients share the same infrastructure while maintaining security and privacy.

4. **Rapid elasticity:**
   - Resources can scale up or down as needed.

5. **Measured service:**
   - Pay only for what you use; usage is transparently monitored.

### Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud (Nube Pública):**
  - Shared infrastructure managed by the service provider.

- **Private Cloud (Nube Privada):**
  - Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization.

- **Hybrid Cloud (Nube Híbrida):**
  - Combines public and private clouds, offering flexibility.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

1. **Convert CAPEX to OPEX:**
   - Reduce initial capital investments; pay only for operational costs.

2. **Massive economies of scale:**
   - AWS offers competitive prices due to its scale.

3. **Increased speed and agility:**
   - Launch resources quickly.

4. **No maintenance of data centers:**
   - Focus on core business activities.

5. **Global reach:**
   - Leverage AWS’ global infrastructure to reduce latency and meet compliance needs.

6. **Enhanced security and fault tolerance:**
   - AWS integrates high-availability solutions.

## AWS Global Infrastructure

- **Regions:**
  - Independent geographical areas with multiple availability zones.
  
- **Availability Zones (Zonas de Disponibilidad):**
  - Discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.

- **Edge Locations:**
  - Optimize content delivery using AWS CloudFront for low-latency performance.

## IAM (Identity and Access Management - Gestión de Identidad y Acceso)

### Key Components

1. **Users and Groups:**
   - Users are individuals with credentials.
   - Groups are collections of users with common permissions.

2. **Policies:**
   - JSON documents that define user/group permissions.
   - Operates under the principle of least privilege.

3. **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):**
   - Adds an additional layer of security using:
     - Virtual MFA devices (e.g., Google Authenticator).
     - Physical security keys (e.g., YubiKey).

4. **Roles:**
   - Temporary credentials for users or AWS services.

### Authentication Methods

- IAM username/password.
- Access keys.
- Federation and external identities.

### Audit Tools

- **CloudTrail:**
  - Logs all AWS API activity for security and compliance audits.

### Best Practices

- Avoid using the root account for daily tasks.
- Enable MFA for all accounts.
- Implement strong password policies.

## Service Models

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
   - Example: Amazon EC2.
   - Offers virtualized computing resources with maximum flexibility.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
   - Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
   - Simplifies application deployment and scaling.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):**
   - Example: Amazon Connect.
   - Delivers software applications over the internet.

## AWS Pricing and Cost Management

- **Pay-as-you-go:**
  - Pay for what you use; no upfront commitments.

- **Pricing Calculators:**
  - AWS Pricing Calculator for estimating costs.

- **Cost Explorer:**
  - Analyze usage and billing patterns.

- **AWS Budgets:**
  - Set spending thresholds and alerts.
