## Cloud Computing Fundamentals

### Traditional IT Model (On-Premises)

Before the cloud, organizations managed their own data centers. This required significant upfront capital expenditures (CAPEX) and complex maintenance:

- **Challenges of On-Premises Infrastructure:**
  - Large upfront investment in servers, networking, storage, and physical facilities.
  - Costs for power, cooling, space, and 24/7 on-site personnel.
  - Hardware procurement, installation, and upgrades are time-consuming.
  - Predicting capacity is difficult—overestimate and waste resources; underestimate and fail to meet demand.
  - Scaling resources quickly to meet sudden demand spikes is limited.
  - Disaster recovery (DR) strategies are complex and costly.

This model often hinders agility and innovation due to lengthy procurement cycles and high costs.

### Cloud Computing Model

Cloud computing revolutionizes IT by turning infrastructure into an on-demand resource. Instead of procuring and managing hardware, you access services over the internet as operating expenses (OPEX):

- **Key Advantages:**
  - **Pay-as-You-Go:** Only pay for actual usage.
  - **Rapid Elasticity:** Scale resources up or down within minutes.
  - **No Heavy Upfront Costs:** Minimal capital expenditure.
  - **Global Reach:** Deploy applications globally in minutes.
  - **Focus on Business:** Let the provider handle hardware and infrastructure management.

**Cloud Computing Definition:**
Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, storage, databases, and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. It treats infrastructure more like software—flexible, scalable, and quick to provision—thus accelerating innovation.

### Five Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. **On-Demand Self-Service:**  
   Provision computing resources automatically without human intervention.

2. **Broad Network Access:**  
   Access services from anywhere, via multiple platforms (laptops, mobiles, tablets).

3. **Multi-Tenancy & Resource Pooling:**  
   Shared infrastructure among multiple customers with security and isolation.

4. **Rapid Elasticity:**  
   Scale in or out quickly, seamlessly adjusting capacity based on demand.

5. **Measured Service (Pay-as-You-Go):**  
   Resource usage is monitored, measured, and billed accurately.

### Key Benefits of the Cloud

- **From CAPEX to OPEX:** Reduce total cost of ownership by removing the need for on-site data centers.
- **Economies of Scale:** Providers like AWS leverage vast scale to lower costs for all customers.
- **No More Guessing Capacity:** Scale on-demand—start small and grow as needed.
- **Increase Speed and Agility:** Launch servers, databases, or other services in minutes.
- **Global Reach and High Availability:** Deploy workloads across multiple geographic regions.
- **Focus on Business Value:** Spend time innovating, not maintaining infrastructure.

## Cloud Service Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- **Example:** Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- **What it Offers:**
  - Virtual servers (instances), storage, and networking.
  - You manage the operating system and applications; AWS manages the underlying hardware.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- **Example:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- **What it Offers:**
  - Run and scale applications without managing underlying infrastructure.
  - Automated provisioning of compute capacity, load balancing, scaling, and health monitoring.
  
### Software as a Service (SaaS)

- **Examples:** Salesforce, Google Workspace, Dropbox
- **What it Offers:**
  - Fully managed applications delivered over the internet.
  - No need to maintain servers, patch systems, or handle upgrades.

## Cloud Deployment Models

1. **Public Cloud:**
   - Owned and operated by a third-party provider (e.g., AWS).
   - Multi-tenant environment; pay only for what you use.
   
2. **Private Cloud:**
   - Exclusively operated for a single organization.
   - Greater control, but at the cost of managing infrastructure and maintenance.
   
3. **Hybrid Cloud:**
   - Combination of public and private clouds.
   - Balance flexibility, cost savings, and control.

## Why AWS?

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is the world’s most broadly adopted cloud platform, with more than 200 fully featured services available. Key reasons to choose AWS:

- **Global Leader:** Largest community of customers and partners.
- **Low Cost:** Benefit from AWS’s economies of scale.
- **Elastic and Agile:** Instantly scale resources as business needs evolve.
- **Secure and Compliant:** Strong compliance frameworks, encryption, and isolation.
- **Global Footprint:** Regions and Availability Zones around the world.

**Pricing Model:**
- **Compute:** Pay per hour or second of compute time.
- **Storage:** Pay per GB/month stored.
- **Data Transfer:** Inbound data transfer is typically free, outbound data transfer incurs charges.

## AWS Global Infrastructure

### Key Concepts

1. **Regions:**  
   Geographically isolated areas containing multiple Availability Zones (AZs).  
   Each region is independent, providing full redundancy and connectivity to meet regional compliance and latency requirements.

2. **Availability Zones (AZs):**  
   Multiple, isolated data centers within a region.  
   By deploying across AZs, you achieve high availability and fault tolerance.

3. **Edge Locations (Points of Presence):**  
   Global network of content delivery endpoints to serve content with low latency.
   
4. **Local Zones and Outposts:**  
   Extend AWS infrastructure closer to end-users for ultra-low latency and compliance needs.

**Choosing a Region:** Consider compliance, latency, available services, and cost.  
**Using Multiple AZs:** Enhance availability by distributing workloads across AZs.  
**Utilizing Edge Locations:** Improve content delivery performance with services like Amazon CloudFront.

## Setting Up an AWS Account

1. **Sign Up at [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/):**  
   Provide an email address, payment method, and contact details.
   
2. **Select Support Plan:**  
   The Basic (Free) plan is sufficient for most initial use cases.
   
3. **Start Using the Free Tier:**  
   Many services offer 12-month free tiers and certain permanent free allocations.

**Note:** Keep track of usage to avoid unexpected charges. The AWS Free Tier helps you explore AWS at minimal cost but always be aware of resource usage beyond free limits.
